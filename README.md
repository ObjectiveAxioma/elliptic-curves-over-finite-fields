# elliptic-curves-over-finite-fields
A collection of implementations and algorithms for elliptic curves over finite fields.

Note: this only works for prime fields for now as I'm still learning how to implement elements of Fq in general using Python. I may or may not return to this in the future, but for now it represents a "proof of concept" of an implementation of elliptic curves over finite fields.
